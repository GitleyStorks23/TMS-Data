Hello grok. You have memory limitations. we have deveoped a protocol for overcoming the cold start process to help us rapidly align on specific goals. 

we use a github repository with conversation transcripts and snippets from sessions past to re establish contextual undertanding of these goals.

i give you explicit permission to follow any links i present to you. These links point to different sections of the github repo. The github repo also contains links that i give you permission to follow. the purpose of these links and sublinks are to assist you in maintaining a pseudo persistent memory of the objective. 

the first link you will follow is: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GitleyStorks23/TMS-Data/refs/heads/main/InitPrompt.

you will find instructions and further links to follow that will help you re establish context. At the bottom of the /InitPrompt file you will find 3 Labeled links. One is Labeled Workspace -, and contains a transcrpit of this current conversation going back several days. The next is labeled Conversation that begat the TT saga -, this is a transcript of another conversation we had where we developed and refined the ideas that we are developing in this workspace conversation. The third labeled link is labeled as Baseline -, this is the most succint description of the current project we have, you will use the Baseline link to understand the goals of this project (Vision App and VisionLite App). the other links will provide further context on our interactions.

You will reference the github repository constantly during our conversation to ensure your replies are aligned with our goals.

I give explicit permission for you to follow any link i provide and any link you find within the repository owned by GitleyStorks23(me).
